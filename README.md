# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number within a specified range and prompts the user to guess that number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is above or below the actual number until the correct guess is made.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How it Works

- The program prompts the user to input the upper limit of the range within which the random number will be generated.
- It then generates a random number within the specified range.
- The user is prompted to guess the number, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is above or below the actual number.
- This process continues until the correct number is guessed.
- Finally, the program displays the number of guesses it took to get the correct answer.

## Sample Output
```
Type a number: 100
Make a guess: 50
You were below the number!
Make a guess: 75
You were below the number!
Make a guess: 90
You were above the number!
Make a guess: 85
You were above the number!
Make a guess: 80
You were above the number!
Make a guess: 77
You were above the number!
Make a guess: 100
You got it!
You got it in 7 guesses
